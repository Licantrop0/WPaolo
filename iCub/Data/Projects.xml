           Logo="Images\Projects\Robotdoc.png"
           Url="http://robotdoc.org/"
           Description="The RobotDoC Collegium is a multi-national doctoral training network for the interdisciplinary training on developmental cognitive robotics. The RobotDoc Fellows will acquire hands-on experience through experiments with the open-source humanoid robot iCub." />
  <Project Name="Roboskin"
           Logo="Images\Projects\Roboskin.png"
           Url="http://www.roboskin.eu/"
           Description="RoboSKIN will develop and demonstrate a range of new robot capabilities based on the tactile feedback provided by a robotic skin from large areas of the robot body. Up to now, a principled investigation of these topics has been limited by the lack of tactile sensing technologies." />
